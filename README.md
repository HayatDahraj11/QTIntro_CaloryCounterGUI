# Qt Calorie Counter

This is a Qt GUI application that tracks a person's weight, time of activity, and speed to estimate the number of calories burned.

## **Objective of this Code**
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to create an interactive GUI application using Qt and C++. The main objectives are:

Create an interactive user interface that takes in three inputs: a person's weight, their speed, and the amount of time they've been active.
Implement real-time calculation of calories burned based on the aforementioned inputs.
Display the calculated calories burned in the user interface.
This project exhibits the utilization of Qt's signal-slot mechanism to update the calorie count whenever any of the input parameters change.

## **What I Learnt**
Through this project, I learnt:

Creating and managing a GUI application using the Qt framework.
Using Qt's signal-slot mechanism for real-time updates in the application.
Implementing mathematical calculations based on user input in a GUI application.
Designing a clean and interactive user interface that dynamically updates its display based on user input.
Creating custom classes in C++ and using them in a Qt application.


## **Where This Will Help Me**
This project deepens my understanding of developing interactive GUI applications using the Qt framework and C++. The concepts learnt, such as creating custom C++ classes, managing user inputs, and using signal-slot mechanisms, will serve as a fundamental knowledge that can be built upon to create more complex applications in the future. This project also enhances my proficiency in C++, one of the most versatile programming languages, strengthening my ability to solve a variety of software development problems.
